What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2                          # => 2 (returns 2)

2. puts x = 2                    # nil (returns nil)

3. p name = "Joe"            # => "Joe" (p vs. puts)

4. four = "four"               # => "four" 

5. print something = "nothing"    # => nil 

#p vs. puts vs print
#print does not create new line 
#puts and p create a new line
