#an hash values be arrays? 
#Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

#Yes they can both be represented values of each other 

#hash values as arrays 
hash = {names: ['bob', 'joe', 'susan']}

#array of hashes
arr = [{name: 'bob'}, {name: 'joe'}, {name: 'susan'}]

#while possible to continue nesting hashes into arrays and vice versa, 
#it's important to recognize that better structure is available
#and should be sought after.
