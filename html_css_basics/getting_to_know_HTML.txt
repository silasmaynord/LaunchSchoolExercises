GETTING TO KNOW HTML

SEMANTICS
Semantics is the process of giving content 
meaning and structure by using the proper element. 


EXCEPTION TO SEMANTICS
<div> and <span> are used specifically 
to target styles into specific sets of content in html, 
and have no semantic value


COMMENTS
html comments start with <!-- and end with --> 
css comments start with /* and end with */


HEADINGS 
<h1> through <h6> are block-level elements 
used to break up content and establish heirarchy. 
Example: <h1>Title goes here...</h1> 


PARAGRAPHS 
<p> is a black-level element that often follow headings. 
Example: <p>Paragraph goes here...</p>


BOLD TEXT WITH STRONG 
<strong> and <b> are used to bold text as inline-level elements. 
The difference between the two is that <strong> gives importance 
to bolding text, whereas <b> semantically means giving text a 
stylistic offset. 
Examples: 
<!-- Strong importance -->
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Falling rocks.</p>

<!-- Stylistically offset -->
<p>This recipe calls for <b>bacon</b> and <b>baconnaise</b>.</p>


ITALICIZE
<em> and <i> are used to italicize text as inline-level elements. 
The difference here is that <em> places stressed emphasis on text, 
whereas <i> is used semantically to convey text as alternative voice or tone. 
Example: 
<!-- Stressed emphasis -->
<p>I <em>love</em> Chicago!</p>

<!-- Alternative voice or tone -->
<p>The name <i>Shay</i> means a gift.</p>


BUILDING STRUCTURE
<header>, <nav>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer> 
are all structure-based elements used to divide 
content up on a webpage. 
	
	HEADER 
	<header> is used to identify the "top"
	Example: <header>...</header>
	
	NAVIGATION
	<nav> identifies a section of major navigational links on a page. 
	Example: <nav>...</nav> 

	ARTICLE
	<article> is used to identify independent, self-contained content. 
	The content in <article> should be ready for replication elsewhere 
	without confusion. <artcicle>...</article> 

	SECTION 
	<section> is used to identify thematic grouping of content. 
	Used commonly to break up and provide heirarchy to a page. 
 	<section>...</section> 

	ASIDE
	<aside> holds content tangentially related to the content surrounding it. 
	<aside>...</aside> 

	FOOTER
	<footer> identfies the "end" 

IN PRACTICE	
Example 1:
<header>
  <h1>Styles Conference</h1>
  <h3>August 24&ndash;26th &mdash; Chicago, IL</h3>
</header>

Example 2: 
<section>
  <h2>Dedicated to the Craft of Building Websites</h2>
  <p>Every year the brightest web designers and front-end developers 
  descend on Chicago to discuss the latest technologies. Join us this August!</p>
</section>

Example 3: 
<section>
  <section>
    <h5>Speakers</h5>
    <h3>World-Class Speakers</h3>
    <p>Joining us from all around the world are over twenty fantastic speakers, 
    here to share their stories.</p>
  </section>
  ...
</section>

Example 4: 
<footer>
  <small>&copy; Styles Conference</small>
</footer>


CREATING HYPERLINKS 
<a> is an inline-level element that anchors hyperlinks in a webpage. 
To link one webpage to another, a hyperlink reference (href) is used. 
The href value identifies the destination of the link. 
Example: <a href="http://shayhowe.com">Shay</a>

If the hyperlink links to a another page within the website, 
no domain is given (relative path). If, however, the hyperlink directs the user 
away from the website, the full (or absolute) path is needed. 
Examples:
<!-- Relative Path -->
<a href="about.html">About</a>

<!-- Absolute Path -->
<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>

LINKING TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS
Email links are created by starting the href with mailto:, followed by 
the email address: mailto:contact@website.com 
To add a subject link, follow this with a '?' to bind the 'subject=' to the hyperlink path, spaces are encoded with %20, and line breaks with %0A.
Example: 
<a href="mailto:shay@awesome.com?subject=Reaching%20Out&body=How%20are%20you">Email Me</a>

LINKING TO PARTS OF THE SAME PAGE
'id=...' and '#...' are used to hyperlink sections on the same page. 
Example: 
<body id="top">
  ...
  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  ...
</body>
