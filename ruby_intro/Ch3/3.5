#Edit the method in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen. 2) What does it return now?

#Solution
def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
    puts words
  end
end 
  
scream("Yippeee")

#still returns nil
#the the last value in a method will always be
#returned. Last value being nil because we are 
#using puts.
